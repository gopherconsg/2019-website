description = """This class has been designed over the past 4 years and goes beyond just being a language class. There will be very little teaching of syntax and a big focus on learning how to read and understand the code you are writing. With a big understanding of "if performance matters" then these things matter. We will talk about semantics, guidelines, mechanical sympathy and data oriented design. We are going to talk about writing concurrent code and how to effectively use channels. Then I will dig into benchmarking and profile tooling. We will talk a lot about composition and design.

Everyone is going to be mentally exhausted at the end of the days. We will be challenging every student to think about what they are doing and why. In the 4 years we have taught this material, we never had someone not appreciate the class and feel like they are a better developer for it. If you want to be a better Go developer, code reviewer, designer and architect, this is the class you want to take.

**Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of the Go programming language. Students do not have to be expert Go users, but they will get the most from the workshop if they have completed the majority of the tour (https://tour.golang.org/)."""

description = """Whether you are just getting started in Go or have been writing Go code for a couple years, this class will make sure you have what you need to write simple, quick, robust tests.  We will start with the basics, and work through advanced concepts such as testing asynchronous code as well as mocking and injecting code.  We’ll finish up with looking at some popular testing libraries and CI (continuous integration) approaches.  We believe in a hands-on approach to learning, so bring your laptops and be ready to write a lot of tests! 

Everyone will have a strong understanding of each part of testing.  The test package will be covered in depth, different approaches to table driven testing will be taught, as well as the numerous options for running tests and test suites.  From there, a deep dive into unit, api, and system level testing will be covered.    Students will learn how to test Net/HTTP packages, and how to mock out tests and create test harnesses.  TDD (Test Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior Driven Development) will be covered, and testing packages that correspond to each will be presented as well.  Finally, students will learn the basics on setting up Continuous integration both locally and at the server.

**Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of the Go programming language. Beginners are highly encouraged to attend this training. While not necessary, it will be helpful if you have completed the Go tour (https://tour.golang.org)."""
